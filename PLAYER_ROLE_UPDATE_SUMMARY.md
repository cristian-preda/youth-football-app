# Player Role Update - Summary

## Overview
Updated the player role based on stakeholder feedback to match the parent view design and add comprehensive detailed statistics functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Stats Cards Updated (Main Dashboard)
**Before:**
- Assisturi (Assists)
- Ore jucate (Hours played)

**After:**
- Pase decisive (Decisive passes) - matches parent view
- Minute (Minutes) - shows direct minutes, not hours

**Visual Improvements:**
- Added colored icon backgrounds to all stat cards
- Icons now displayed in colored circles (green, blue, purple, orange)
- Better visual hierarchy and consistency with parent view

### 2. Clickable Player Profile Card
- Player info card is now interactive
- Added ChevronRight icon to indicate clickability
- Hover effect (scale 1.02) and tap effect (scale 0.98)
- Clicking opens detailed statistics view

### 3. New: Detailed Statistics View
A comprehensive view similar to the parent's "Copilul meu" view, featuring:

#### A. Clickable Stats Grid
Four stat cards that expand to show per-match details:
- **Goluri (Goals)**: Click to see goals scored in each match
- **Pase decisive (Assists)**: Click to see assists given in each match
- **Minute (Minutes)**: Click to see minutes played per match
- **CartonaÈ™e (Cards)**: Click to see yellow/red cards per match

#### B. Per-Match Breakdown
When a stat card is clicked, shows:
- Match opponent name
- Match date
- Specific stat for that match (e.g., "2 goluri", "45 min")
- Visual badges for cards (ðŸŸ¨ yellow, ðŸŸ¥ red)
- Collapsible - click again to hide

#### C. Medical History Section
Simple design as requested:
- Shows injury/illness records
- Severity badges (high/medium/low)
- Dates and recovery information

- Clean empty state when no records exist

#### D. Team Recent Matches
Similar to parent view:
