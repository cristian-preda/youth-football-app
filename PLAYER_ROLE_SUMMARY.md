## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

1. **Age-Appropriate**: Simple, visual, encouraging - perfect for kids 7-15
2. **Light Gamification**: Achievement badges celebrate milestones without overwhelming
3. **Personal Focus**: "Your stats" not "team stats" - makes it personal
4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrates contributions ("Ai marcat!", "Ai dat assist!")
5. **Context Awareness**: Shows team and coach info so player understands their context
6. **Future-Ready**: Structure supports adding more achievements or stats later

## 📱 User Flow

5. Can navigate to:
