```

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

1. **Age-Appropriate**: Simple, visual, encouraging - perfect for kids 7-15
2. **Light Gamification**: Achievement badges celebrate milestones without overwhelming
3. **Personal Focus**: "Your stats" not "team stats" - makes it personal
4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrates contributions ("Ai marcat!", "Ai dat assist!")
5. **Context Awareness**: Shows team and coach info so player understands their context
6. **Future-Ready**: Structure supports adding more achievements or stats later

## 📱 User Flow

1. Player logs in → sees Dashboard with welcome message
2. Views personal stats and achievements
3. Checks attendance rate and upcoming events
4. Reviews recent matches and personal contributions
5. Can navigate to:
   - **Program** - Full schedule view
   - **Mesaje** - Team communications
   - **Club** - League standings
   - **Profil** - Personal profile settings

## 🔄 Integration Points

- Player Dashboard reads from existing Player records
- Uses team events for attendance and matches
- Filters attendance records by player ID
- Calculates achievements dynamically from stats
- Bottom navigation uses default auth tabs (no changes needed)

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

   - `player-5` (Ștefan Munteanu) - 15 goals, 4 assists
3. Navigate through dashboard sections
